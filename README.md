# Bike Share Data Analysis

This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Term 1.

* Used Python (Pandas and Numpy) to perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider
* Compared the system usage for three large cities in the United States : Chicago , New York and Washington DC
* Performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems
* Computed descriptive statistics to gain insights and created visualizations using matplotlib
